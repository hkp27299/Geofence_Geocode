# Idea behind script

- I want to build gadget for children to pointing there location if they are out of my fence so i will get notification about it 



## About Script
<pre>
1. Change value of gmap in geocoding.py to plot points into map.
   It will create html file and save it as grocode.html

2. Now using geofence.html you can create fence in map and save text file into your machine
</pre>

#### Work needed

- Need server to make real use of this script and some UI to operate this script
